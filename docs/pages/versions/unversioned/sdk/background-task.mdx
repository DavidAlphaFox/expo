`expo-background-task` provides an API to run deferrable background tasks in a way that optimises battery and power consumption for the end user. This module is using the [`Background Tasks`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks) API on iOS and the [`WorkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) API on Android to schedule tasks, and the [Expo TaskManager](task-manager.mdx) Native API for running JavaScript tasks.

## Background Tasks

A background task is a deferrable unit of work that is performed in the background, outside the lifecycle of your app. This is useful for tasks that need to be executed when the app is not active, such as syncing data with a server, fetching new content, or even checking if there are any [Expo Updates](updates.mdx) pending.

### When are background tasks run?

The Expo Background Task API leverages each platform to execute tasks at the most optimal time for both the user and the device.

This means that the task may not run immediately after it is scheduled, but it will run at some point in the future if the system decides so.

A background task will only run if the battery has enough charge (or the device is plugged into power) and the network is available. Without these conditions, the task won't execute.

### When will they stop?

The native platform APIs will stop running background tasks if the user explicitly kills the app (they will be resumed when the user restarts the app) or if the app is uninstalled. If the device is rebooted or the app crashes, the background tasks will be resumed.

> **Info** The non-deterministic behavior of background tasks is intentional, aimed at optimizing battery life and enhancing user experience. If a user force-closes an app, the system interprets this as a signal not to run background tasks for that app until the user restarts it.

## Platform differences

### Android&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['android']} />

On Android, the [`WorkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) API allows specifying a minimum interval for a task to run (at least 15 minutes). The task will execute sometime after the interval has passed, provided the specified conditions are met.

### iOS&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

On iOS, the [`Background Tasks`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks) API decides the best time to launch your background task. The system will consider the battery level, the network availability, and the user's usage patterns to determine when to run the task.

## Known limitations

### iOS&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

The [`Background Tasks`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks) API on iOS is only available when running on a device.

## Installation

<APIInstallSection />

## Configuration&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

To be able to run background tasks on iOS, you need to add the `processing` value to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's **Info.plist** file. This is required for background fetch to work properly.

**If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)**, the required `UIBackgroundModes` configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

<Collapsible summary="Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS">

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)) or you're using a native iOS project, then you'll need to add the following to your **Expo.plist** file:

```xml ios/project-name/Supporting/Expo.plist
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
    <string>processing</string>
  </array>
</key>
```

## Usage

Below is an example that demonstrates how to use `expo-background-task`.

<SnackInline label="Background Task Usage" dependencies={['expo-background-task', 'expo-task-manager']}>

```tsx
import * as BackgroundTask from 'expo-background-task';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

const BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER = 'background-task';

// Register / create the task so that it is available also when the background task screen
// is not visible. Remember that this needs to be called in the global scope,
// not in a React component (like in this example)
TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER, async () => {
  try {
    const now = Date.now();
    console.log(`Got background task call at date: ${new Date(now).toISOString()}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to execute the background task:', error);
    return BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskResult.Failed;
  }
  return BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskResult.Success;
});

// 2. Register the task at some point in your app by providing the same name
// Note: This does NOT need to be in the global scope and CAN be used in your React components!
async function registerBackgroundTaskAsync() {
  return BackgroundTask.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER);
}

// 3. (Optional) Unregister tasks by specifying the task name
// This will cancel any future background task calls that match the given name
// Note: This does NOT need to be in the global scope and CAN be used in your React components!
async function unregisterBackgroundTaskAsync() {
  return BackgroundTask.unregisterTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER);
}

export default function BackgroundTaskScreen() {
  const [isRegistered, setIsRegistered] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskStatus | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    checkStatusAsync();
  }, []);

  const checkStatusAsync = async () => {
    const status = await BackgroundTask.getStatusAsync();
    setStatus(status);
  };

  const toggle = async () => {
    if (isRegistered) {
      await registerBackgroundTaskAsync();
    } else {
      await unregisterBackgroundTaskAsync();
    }
    setIsRegistered(!isRegistered);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.screen}>
      <View style={styles.textContainer}>
        <Text>
          Background Task Service Availability:{' '}
          <Text style={styles.boldText}>
            {status ? BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskStatus[status] : null}
          </Text>
        </Text>
      </View>
      <Button
        disabled={status === BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskStatus.Restricted}
        title={isRegistered ? 'Cancel Background Task' : 'Schedule Background Task'}
        onPress={toggle}
      />
      <Button title="Check Background Task Status" onPress={checkStatusAsync} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  screen: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  textContainer: {
    margin: 10,
  },
  boldText: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

## Testing background tasks

Background tasks can be difficult to test because they can happen inconsistently. Fortunately, Expo BackgroundTask contains some tools that help make testing background tasks easier.

Expo BackgroundTask has a convenient helper on iOS that triggers executing the background task worker. This will only work in `debug` mode:

```ts
import * as BackgroundTask from 'expo-background-task';

export const triggerBackgroundTask = async () => {
  await BackgroundTask.triggerTaskWorkerForTestingAsync();
};
```

> Make sure the task is defined and registered in your app for it to work.

### Android&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['android']} />

On Android, the easiest way to test background tasks is to register a task. When the app is in `debug` mode, a background task should be started as soon as possible, while in release mode, it will wait until the minimum interval has passed before running the task.

> In release mode, the app must be in the background for the background task to run, while in debug mode, the task will run even if the app is in the foreground.

### iOS&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

On iOS, testing background tasks is done by [simulating](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/starting-and-terminating-tasks-during-development#Launch-a-Task) the launch of the task. This can be done by calling the `triggerTaskWorkerForTestingAsync` method in JavaScript.

## Multiple background tasks

Since the Background Tasks API on iOS and the WorkManager API on Android limit the number of tasks that can be scheduled for a single app, Expo BackgroundTask uses a single worker on both platforms. While you can define multiple JavaScript background tasks, they will all run through this single worker.

On Android, the first registered background task determines the minimum interval for execution.

## API

```js
import * as BackgroundTask from 'expo-background-task';
```

<APISection packageName="expo-background-task" apiName="BackgroundTask" />
